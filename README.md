# About

Site visible at: https://emersonfloriano.github.io/todo-list/

A simple web application to list and manage tasks.

To create this application, I used basic React concepts, such as: properties, components, state and Hooks.

# Stack

- React + Typescirpt
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Nano ID](https://github.com/ai/nanoid#readme)
- CSS Modules
- [PhosphorIcons](https://phosphoricons.com/)

# Features

- Add task
- Remove task
- Mark as completed / not completed

# How it Works

Clone the repo and enter in directory

```
git clone https://github.com/EmersonFloriano/todo-list.git

cd todo-list
```

Install dependencies

```
yarn
or
npm install
```

Run the development server

```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
